    "# Data Science Bowl 2017 - Improve Lung Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Science Bowl, presented by Booz Allen and Kaggle, is a data science for social good competition.  It's open to data scientists, technologists, domain experts, and organizations to take on the worldâ€™s challenges with data and technology.  In this year's competition, the challenge is to use machine learning to quickly detect lung cancer.  I chose to do this competition to flex my machine learning skills to tackle an issue that is affecting hundreds of thousands of people per year.  \n",

    "## Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, lung cancer strikes 225,000 people every year, and accounts for $12 billion in health care costs. Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival.  According to the [National Institutes of Health(NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/), 20% of lung cancer deaths can be reduced with early detection.  There is also a high number of false positive rates that result from existing image assessments.  This means that there's a high number of lung lesions that are diagnosed as cancerous that later turn out to be benign.  This leads to patient anxiety and the added cost of follow-up imaging and treatments that may not be needed at all.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) provided [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/data) containing thousands of lung scans, which I will explore first.  The [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/rules) also allows for use of external data.  \n"
